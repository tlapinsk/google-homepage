# The Odin Project: Google Homepage

### Created by: Tim Lapinskas

This project was created in conjunction with and guided by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101). Very much looking forward to seeing how this goes.

Just finished up the Google homepage project, and had tons of fun. It took me ~5 working hours, which ended up not being too bad honestly. I am trying to publish the page to Githubs awesome pages feature [here](https://tlapinsk.github.io/google-homepage/), but it seems to be having trouble right now. 

Big thanks to The Odin Project!
