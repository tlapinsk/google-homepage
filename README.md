# The Odin Project: Google Homepage

### Created by: Tim Lapinskas

This project was created in conjunction with and guided by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101).

Just finished up the Google homepage project, and had tons of fun. It took me ~5 working hours, which ended up not being too bad honestly. I have published my final page [here](https://tlapinsk.github.io/google-homepage/) (shoutout to Github Pages for being awesome).

Big thanks to The Odin Project!
